## Descripiton

Your basic task is to recreate the Pyramid Website using React JS only. The website must be responsive. Making the grid is not important, but if you are really interested in making it, please work on it after you have completed the other parts of the website. I have set up the basic react app, and added all the required assets for the website. Please add the components into an separate folder and keep the code organised. Each of you should pull the repository and create a separate branch, and the name of the branch will be your name. All of your changes and code should be pushed into your respective branches in the repository.

To run this app use `npm start` or `yarn start` on your directory

Please create a Pull Request everytime you push your code to your branch, but please don't merge it with the main branch. Make sure that your pull requests follow the below mentioned format.

## Pull Request and Commit Messages format

Its a simple format. The title of the PR should be the Component Name and then followed by a list of things that have been completed. For example:

### About Us

- Added Images
- Added header and description
- Styled the header
- Styled the images

## Reporting

Once you have pushed your code to the repository and created a pull request, please ping me on the React General channel and just type down whatever you have worked on.
